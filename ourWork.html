          <span style="margin-top: 6%">The main activity for KETSA Community is to organize seminars for the youth, where resource persons educate the youth on the various aspects of life and growth in the society.
          The seminars organised so far were in partnership with the Fireflies(a humanitarian group). The chain of seminars was dubbed ‘The Mentorship Train’.
          Some selected Junior High Schools(JHS) were visited in Bolgatanga, Upper East Region in May 2017. These seminars were in preparation towards their Basic Education Certificate Examination. Volunteers from various Senior High Schools and Tertiary Institutions helped made this a success as they shared their experiences to these students to help encourage, inspire and prepare them for their examination.</span>

            <span style="margin-top: 6%">
            Another activity of the KETSA community is charity work. We donate items to communities and charity homes as a symbol of encouraging the youth to give back to society. 
            The first charity outreach was done in collaboration with the National Optometric Students Association; NOSA KNUST chapter and IcarePro in December 2016.
            This outreach was dubbed ‘The Christmas Food Drive’. Food items were gathered mainly through donations and were presented to some widows and orphans around Ayeduase, Kotei, Deduako, Appiadu and Emena Boadi in the Ashanti Region. As part of the outreach, an eye screening exercise was done for the beneficiaries. 
            Another charity outreach was embarked on in May 2017. This outreach was also in collaboration with the National Optometric Students Association; NOSA KNUST chapter and Soul Ministers. The outreach was dubbed ‘The clothing drive’. Clothes donated to us were presented to the indigenes of Buodekwano, a community in the Ashanti Region.
            Both the Christmas food drive and Clothing drive were a great success and we are grateful to all our donors.</span>
